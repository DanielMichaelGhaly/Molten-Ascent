# Molten-Ascent
Molten Ascent is a vertical survival platformer built with OpenGL primitives. Climb a collapsing cavern as rising lava threatens your life. Collect gems to boost your score and reveal the key to unlock the Fire Gate. Avoid falling rocks, use power-ups, and reach the top before the lava consumes everything!
